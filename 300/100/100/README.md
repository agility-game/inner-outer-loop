# 100 - 1. Code Your App

Developing a Docker application is similar to the way you develop an application without Docker. The difference is that while developing for Docker, you're deploying and testing your application or services running within Docker containers in your local environment (either a Linux VM setup by Docker or directly Windows if using Windows Containers).

For the purpose of a universal solution, we subscribe to **gitpod.io**, a service that lets us turn our source code into a Docker container hosted development environment. In our GitHub repositories - where we keep our source code - all one has to do is click the **[GitPod icon] Open** button near the top of the page when at the start of repository, and gitpod will direct us to this development environment automatically (**note**: the name of the GitHub repository is extended by some random characters, e.g. ```https://agilitygame-home-t4ywwnrcngu.ws-eu111.gitpod.io/```).
