# 100 - Inner Loop: Workflow for developing Docker container-based applications

This section describes the **inner-loop** development workflow for Docker container-based applications. The inner-loop workflow means it's not considering the broader DevOps workflow (aka *outer-loop*), which can include up to production deployment, and just focuses on the development work done on the developer's computer. The initial steps to set up the environment aren't included, since those steps are done only once.
