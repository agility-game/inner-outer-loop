# 200 - Outer Loop: Docker Application Outer Loop DevOps Workflow

This presents an end-to-end depiction of the steps comprising the DevOps outer-loop workflow. It shows the "outer loop" of DevOps. When code is pushed to the repo, a CI pipeline is started, then begins the CD pipeline, where the application gets deployed. Metrics collected from deployed applications are fed back into the development workload, where the "inner loop" occurs, so development teams have actual data to respond to user and business needs.
